# Multitasking in micael

Right now micael provides simple cooperative multitasking model which isn't very useful just yet.

I've made an example of multitasking usage in commit c0d1b7. You can take a closer look by branching to that commit and browsing files

`git checkout -b coopmulti c0d1b7 && git show`

or

`git checkout -b coopmulti 02f73fd && git show`

# Future
I'm currently in the process of improving multitasking significantly and in the near future micael should have a priority based scheduling and support for processes.
