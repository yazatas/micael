# micael

micael is a 32-bit monolithic kernel written in C and x86 assembly.

You'll need a [cross-compiler](http://wiki.osdev.org/GCC_Cross-Compiler) to compile micael on your system (don't worry, it's easy to build). In case you just want to run micael, you'll need QEMU.

# Compiling and running

Run following commands to compile and run micael:

`./build.sh; ./run`
